      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary, first published as a W3C Recommendation in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT]], designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> (<abbr title="Dataset Exchange Working Group">DXWG</abbr>) has developed a new version of DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], which extends [[VOCAB-DCAT]] to support further use cases and requirements [[DCAT-UCR]]. These include the possibility of cataloging other resources in addition to datasets, such as data services, and of describing relationships between datasets as well as between datasets and other cataloged resources.</p>
<p>To show that the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] are implementable as well as broadly adopted, we collected evidence in the form of vocabularies, data catalogs, data services, and datasets (<a href="#evidence"></a>). The results are summarized in this report.</p>
